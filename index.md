## About Me

I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at the University of Kansas. My advisor is <a href="https://witt.ku.edu">Emily Witt</a>. I received my bachelors degrees in mathematics and in chemical engineering from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. In my free time I enjoy cooking, cycling, and playing disc golf.

## Research Interests

I work mainly in commutative algebra and homological algebra. Specifically, I am interested in local cohomology and related invariants. I also dabble in algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics.

## Where To Find Me
- My office is 637 Snow Hall.
- I will be attending KMGSC at Kansas State University on April 13-14th.
- I will be (remotely) attending the "Recent Developments in Commutative Algebra" SLMath workshop April 15-19th.
