## About Me

I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at the University of Kansas. My advisor is <a href="https://witt.ku.edu">Emily Witt</a>. I received my bachelors degrees in mathematics and in chemical engineering from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. In my free time I enjoy cooking, cycling, and playing disc golf.

## Research Interests
