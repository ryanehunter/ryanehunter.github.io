## About Me

I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at the University of Kansas. My advisor is <a href="https://witt.ku.edu">Emily Witt</a>. I received my bachelors degrees in mathematics and in chemical engineering from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. In my free time I enjoy cooking, cycling, and playing disc golf.

## Research Interests

I work mainly in commutative algebra and homological algebra. Specifically, I am interested in local cohomology and related invariants. I also dabble in algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics.

## Where To Find Me

- I will be attending <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kumunu-2024/home">KUMUNU</a> at the University of Missouri on September 28 and 29.
